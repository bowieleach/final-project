### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

#Getting the main plot points to function as a game with some rough art. (Or just a good portion of the game)

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

#The above with more details and more finished art.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

#The above with a completely polished look and complete art/story.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

#I need to learn how to make a visual novel in RenPy. I will also need to work on my storytelling and writing as a visual novel is a different style of writing than I usually do.
