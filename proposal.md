# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

#Playlistify idk

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

#A website that lets you upload and store your spotify playlists and customize them more than you can on Spotify.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

#It will be a website made with Python that let's you customize your playlist more than Spotify allows. This means it will let you have descriptions for each song, longer descriptions, etc.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

#n/a

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

#n/a

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

#Making a website and connecting it to Spotify.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

#Allowing users to store playlists on it.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

#A website where you can customize your playlists more in depth than Spotify lets you.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

#I need to learn how to make a website in Python. I also need to research Spotify's API and learn how to get it working on a website. I want to make it so you can customize playlists more in depth than you can in Spotify(adding a description for each song, longer descriptions, etc.) Then, my last step is to make the website look clean and easy to use.
