Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

# I have started work on the actual RenPy file and mapped out most of the choices and things to implement.

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

# I have not drawn most of the art.

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

# Downloading and setting up RenPy took a while because of some bugs and I had to figure out a way around it. The story idea of my vn was a bit ambitious and I decided to kind of change it so it could be more simple and (hopefully) complete
# I also had to make changes to the story because it was too ambitious for this project
