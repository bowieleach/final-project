# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

#1. website to organize spotify playlists and add more in depth information for them. i always want to add a description/reason for each song i add to my playlists so this would allow people to do that.

#2. visual novel
    #a. an excerpt from the story my friend and i have been planning. not sure if this counts as collaborating as he is not in this class, but i would do everything myself except for the story/plot planning elements.
    
    #b. story by me, not sure what yet...

#3. making a short game
    #not sure what yet..

## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?

#n/a

## Do you have any questions of your own?
